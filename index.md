# Welcome to our house!

First off thank you for being willing to hang with the puppies! They'll enjoy your time and ensure you're never lonely. Second, the dogs are the number one priority over anything else in the house! In the case of emergencies ensure their safety over any object or papers in the house, of course after your own safety. All of that can be replaced, the pups can't be. 

# The Puppies


## Lola

This is Lola and she is a tornado of Love make sure you bend your knees to meet her or you might get knocked to the ground. She doesn't know when to stop playing so you'll have to make sure she won't overheat if you're playing outside. 


## Henna

Meet Henna, part time potato, part time dog! She's a bundle of love and will cuddle behind you all day if you let her.   

## General Guidelines
- Don't use the front door
- Every morning after they go to the bathroom they each get a half-toothbrush stick from the kitchen pantry
- Toothbrushes are in the kitchen pantry
- If you don't want someone sleeping with you at night leave them downstairs with the gate closed
- When you leave the house don't use the front door, and make sure the gate to the upstairs is closed
- Don't leave them outside for too long. Lola will beg to go out constantly but they like to dig at the fence and they barka the neighbor's dogs when they're outside. 
- They may stink a little after coming in from the outside but it'll go away after a few minutes. 
- Both dogs will do most things for a cookie if you can't get her to come inside. 
- Cookies are in the pantry in the kitchen on the bottom floor. 
# Emergency Retrieval
- This is a just in case you don't follow the guidelines and one dog gets outside. 
- You can chase Henna for 3 seconds and then once she turns to see you start running in the opposite direction and then run into the house when she starts chasing you. 
- For Lola if you yell at her loud enough, and show her a cookie she might listen. If not there are tennis balls in the tv stand that she'd die for. 
- Grab one and bounce it on the floor to get her attention and then throw it in the house. 

# Schedule and Details

- Feeding
  - Once a Day after 8pm
  - One Dry Scoop and 1/2 a can of wet food
  - Feed them at the same time and about 10 feet apart
  - Watch Lola to make sure she doesn't bother Henna until she's done eating
- Going Potty
  - Usually take them out when you wake up
  - We don't take them out until around noon usually. But If you get them up earlier they'll ask to go out. 
- Drinking water
  - After playing outside Lola will drink a gallon of water. It's essential no more playing occurs for the next 30 minutes or she will throw it up 
- Playtime (Optional)
  - whenever you want, they're more than happy to play with each other and eat their bones
  - There are balls in the right drawer of the tv stand. This is a very special treat for Lola and you'll have to make sure to put the ball back in the drawer after playing. Don't play with her too long she doesn't know her own limits and will play too long. Especially in the summer heat. 
- Lola's Medical Issues
  - She likes to throw up out of the blue most of the time it's just water. 
  - If she's licking her nail a lot she may have broken it and you'll have to put on her donut of shame. 


# Working with Google

  - Most of the flood lights in the house are smart lights. 
  - They can be controlled via any of the google devices.

  - She's also full of fun facts and can tell you bedtime stories. Just say `Hey Google Talk to Calm` and follow her prompts
  - You can use her to broadcast messages to everyong in the home `Hey Google Broadcast breakfast is ready`
  - Or set an alarm for you in the morning `Hey Google set an alarm for eight a.m.`
  - She can also stream for you `Hey google play funny videos on the TV`
  - You can use her just as you would a regular google search as well
